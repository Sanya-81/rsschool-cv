## Information about yourself
Without bad habits. I appreciate a professional approach to solving problems in people. I have a tendency to perseverance, which is why I love chess and other logic games. I strive to look for solutions to the problem without putting it off.
Pedantry comes first, because I value the quality, not the amount of work done.

>An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

```JavaScript

function isIsogram(str){
  let str2 = str.toUpperCase().split('');
  str2 = str2.filter( tokken => str2.indexOf(tokken) == str2.lastIndexOf(tokken))
  return str2.length == str.length
}

isIsogram("Dermatoglyphics") == true
isIsogram("aba") == false
isIsogram("moOse") == false
