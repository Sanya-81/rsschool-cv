## Information about yourself
Without bad habits. I appreciate a professional approach to solving problems in people. I have a tendency to perseverance, which is why I love chess and other logic games. I strive to look for solutions to the problem without putting it off.
Pedantry comes first, because I value the quality, not the amount of work done.
